# linuxdeploy-desktopfile

Dependency-free C++11 desktop file library. Parse and write desktop files. Working on standard conformance!

This fork removes the on-by-default `-DBUILD_TESTING` option and cmake code
coverage scripts. Some file re-structuing has also been done to clean the
library to make it both smaller and easier to add as a git submodule.
